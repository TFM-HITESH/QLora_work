For Review 2 :

Practical/Code Deliverables

1. Basic Frontend UI of orchestration website (I have a template). It will have basic login and signup too. When you login, you reach a dashboard where you can add a new dataset, add a new model (supported ones) and begin training.

- Create the basic plan/README/spec of this into /deliverables/FRONTEND.md

2. Code/Notebook of at least 1 model with at least some basic version of QLORA on video implemented.

- Create the basic guide + pseudocode + code for this into /deliverables/NOTEBOOK.md

3. Pipeline of getting all metrics as shown in README/GOALS.md

- Create the basic implementation/guide into /deliverables/METRICS.md

Document Deliverables

1. Basic API spec sheet using Mintlify Documentation so that our service can be used outside of the UI.

- Create the sheet as Markdown for now in /deliverables/SPEC.md

2. Research Oriented Document that contains all the stuff like Litreature Review, Research Gap etc.

- Create this document into /deliverables/RESEARCH.md

3. Dev/Software Oriented Document that contains documentation, SRS, SDS, implementation diagrams, UML diagrams etc.

- Create this document into /deliverables/SOFTWARE.md

4. Presentation PPT to be presented tommorow.

- Create the template or content in /deliverales/PRESENTATION.md
