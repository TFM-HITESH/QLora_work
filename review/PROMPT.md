I am working on a review which is due tommorrow. I need your help. The main CONTEXT is in CONTEXT.md, which will tell you my situation.

After which, I want you to go through INSTRUCTIONS.md. It will detail what all I am aiming to achieve in the next 10 hours.

Then go through DELIVERABLES.md to understand everything I will be giving. Improve it to specify and give details. Also create the requisite files in /deliverables.

Then go through PLAN.md to see my current approach. Improve it if possible with more detail.

PAPER.md is the high quality view of how the research document will look. No need to be this exact and high quality. But do try and get a faithful recreation of this in the research document deliverable.

GOALS.md and README.md contains the research I did back when the scope of the project was not defined. It currently follows CONTEXT.md, so you need not exactly follow these, but use them to enrich your context such as understanding the metrics to be used.

Some points to note:

- Focus on ease and simplicity of implementing these things in short time. We are not trying to break the world, just want a simple patent out of this over the next one month.
- I want to try and impress my faculty. So keep that in mind.
- Ask me if you have any other questions, and include my responses into this PROMPT.md so that I dont have to keep reeingineering the context.
