# 🎬 Multimodal QLoRA: Efficient Video-Text Pretraining via Temporal and Cross-Modality Aware Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation

> 🧠 **Objective:** Build a novel, memory-efficient, and high-performing fine-tuning framework for video-language models using QLoRA—extended with temporal dynamics and modality-aware rank allocation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores and extends Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) for **video-language pretraining and downstream tasks**, introducing multiple innovations such as:

- Temporal-aware adaptation mechanisms
- Cross-modal rank modulation
- Quantization-aware frame selection
- Theoretical scaling and memory-performance tradeoffs

Target venues: **TPAMI**, **TMLR**, **CVPR/ICCV**, **ACL Findings**, **NeurIPS D&B**

## ✅ Core Contributions

> These are the **minimum bar** to reach Q1-level relevance.

- [ ] ✅ First integration of QLoRA into video-language models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, Flamingo).
- [ ] ✅ Full reproducibility: Code, configs, training scripts open-sourced.
- [ ] ✅ Benchmarks across standard datasets (MSR-VTT, ActivityNet Captions, VATEX, LSMDC).
- [ ] ✅ Comparisons: Full FT vs LoRA vs QLoRA vs other PEFTs (adapters, prefix-tuning).
- [ ] ✅ Metrics: Memory (training & inference), BLEU/CIDEr/Recall@K, latency, FLOPs.
- [ ] ✅ Ablations on bit-width, rank size, adapter placement.

## 🚀 Novel Research Contributions

> These unlock **true Q1-level novelty** and can differentiate the work for top labs like DeepMind/OpenAI.

- [ ] 🔁 **Temporal-Aware QLoRA**
  - Gated rank updates conditioned on frame motion or entropy.
  - Time-aware adapters or selective update policies.
  
- [ ] 🎭 **Cross-Modality Rank Allocation**
  - Different ranks per modality (e.g., vision-heavy adapters).
  - Dynamically adjusted via frame entropy or modality weight.

- [ ] 🧮 **Quantization-Aware Frame Selection**
  - Use entropy or scene change detection to subsample frames.
  - Retain performance with fewer inputs → efficient compute.

- [ ] 📈 **Theoretical Scaling Laws**
  - Rank vs performance vs memory tradeoffs.
  - Pareto frontiers for accuracy vs FLOPs/memory.

- [ ] 🌍 **Generalization Beyond Video-Text**
  - Audio-video-text, instruction-tuned multimodal LMs.
  - Multilingual QA or summarization.

- [ ] 🏗️ **Unified QLoRA Framework**
  - Modular, plug-and-play PEFT setup for any modality or task.
  - HuggingFace-compatible interface or PyTorch Lightning plugin.

## 🎯 Acceptance Guidelines

You will **likely get into a Q1 journal** if:
- [ ] You achieve **comparable or better performance** than LoRA/Full FT with **less memory**
- [ ] You present **2–3 novel contributions** with ablations and insight
- [ ] Your paper is **clear, polished, and reproducible**
- [ ] You show **real-world generalization** or multimodal robustness

You will **likely be rejected** if:
